# AR-EarthRotationEffect
As part of my final year project, I developed this game in Unity for school-going kids in elementary grades. 

This small informatic 'gameplay' allows the students to learn about some interesting facts about planet Earth.
It uses Augmented Reality to display a model of the Earth in front of the user when the application is run.
With this, the students can rotate the Earth based on a touch-based interaction or watch it rotate on its on
as the 'Spin Free' script is implemented. As the model rotates, different facts are displayed. 

Below are some images of the application:
